        "elestiri":"Like many a literary work of the so-called postmodern period, Marina Carr’s famous 1998 play By the Bog of Cats is a critical echo chamber of prior texts, whether near or far in space and time from its setting in the Irish midlands in the late 20th century. The literature of prior eras lacked neither for influences nor allusions, but postmodern writers call on precursors neither to buttress their own intellectual authority (à la Dante or Milton) nor to stabilize their otherwise unwieldy subject matter (à la Joyce or Eliot). The postmodern writer, especially if she also construes herself as a postcolonial or a feminist writer, echoes earlier texts with an attitude of critical scrutiny—to discover what went wrong, allusion as (per Adrienne Rich) “diving into the wreck.”",

        "elestiri":"Yesterday for St. Patrick’s Day I read these two classic early 20th-century dramas by the Irish playwright J. M. Synge. The texts I used were from the first edition of the Norton Critical Modern Irish Drama, and all quotations from critical and contextual sources below come from materials in that book unless otherwise noted. Synge was a member of the Protestant middle classes, but in the nationalist ferment leading to Irish independence, he developed a fascination with the life and culture of the Catholic peasantry in the West of Ireland, which formed the basis of his drama. Irish modernist literature, with its anti- and postcolonial themes, its meditations on nature, language, and culture, was in the vanguard of a decolonizing century’s world literature; so Synge’s plays of the primordial “West”—and their controversial reception—anticipate debates that continue to this day about the relation of culture to literature and about the censorship of representations that fall short of the one-dimensionally triumphal. Even readers indifferent to these questions, though, will revel in Synge’s explosively inventive language, which he claimed to derive from the voices he heard around him in the West:",
